#TossCraft

In TossCraft, the player interacts with a variety of spheres representing real world objects such as foot-, bowling- or bouncyballs. To proceed in the game, the spheres have to be physically moved into a given target by the player. In some cases, hitting a target is sufficient as well. That can be done by either throwing or punching the sphere. Reaching the target is accomplished by overcoming different challenges. As the game starts off easy, by progressing in the game, every level becomes more challenging demanding the player to be even more careful about his actions. To finish the game, the player has to solve all maps.
